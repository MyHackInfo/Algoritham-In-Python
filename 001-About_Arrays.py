Arrays: Data Structure
     ** A collection of elemements/values each identifued by an array index or key!!!
       -Index start at Zero
       -Because of the indexes:random access is possible

Advantages:
       -Arrays are data Structures in order to store items of the same type
       -Dynamic array:when the size of the array is changing daynamically
       -Applications:lookup tables/hashtables, heaps
       -We can use random access Because of the keys:getitem(int index) will return the
        value with the given key very fast // O(1)
       -Very easy to implement and to use
       -Very fast dat Structure
       -We should use array in Applications when we want to add items over and over again
        and we want to take items with given indexes!!! ~ It will be fast

Disadvantages:
        -We have to know the size of the array at complie-time: so it is not so
            dynamic data Structure
        -If it is full: we have to create a bigger array and have to copy the values one by one
            // reconsturcting an array is O(N) operation
        -It is not able to store items with different types


Multidimensional Arrays: It can prove to be very important in mathematical related computations(matrixes)
        -number[][] two dimensional Arrays
        -First parameter: row index
        -Second parameter:column index
